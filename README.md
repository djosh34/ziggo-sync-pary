## FAQ

### Do you support chat?

The extension doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll probably have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.

### Do you support syncing across multiple episodes?

We currently don't support syncing across multiple episodes, but you can easily generate a new link once the new episode starts.
